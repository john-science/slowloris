## Part 5: Functions

Functions are created with the `lambda` form, which returns an instance of `Closure` (find the class definition in `slowloris/types.py`). Here we have the example of a very simple function to calculate the square of a number:

```lisp
(def square
    (lambda (n) 
        n * n))
```

In the example above, the function generated by the lambda expression is attached to the name `square`. Noticed we used the same `def` symbol to attach this lambda function to a name. When a number is passed to this function the body of the function is called and the last line returns the results.  To use this function, you would type:

```lisp
(square 3)
```

Of course, this would return `9`. And the following would return `16`:

```lisp
(square (square (square 2)))
```
