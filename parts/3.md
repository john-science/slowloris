## Part 3: REPL

### Execute Slow Loris Code Interactively

The easiest way to run Slow Loris code is to do it interactively in the read-eval-print-loop (REPL).

Start the REPL from the command line, and try the language as we move along. Here is a basic example using the `if` symbol:

```bash
./repl
→  (if (> 42 100)
…      'foo
…      'bar)
bar
```
Remember, if you make any changes to the standard libraries or your own `*.sl` files, you will need to restart the REPL for it to pick up any changes you make to the language.
