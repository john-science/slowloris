## Part 3: REPL

### The REPL: Play while you work

Now that we are beginning to get an interpreter going, we can start testing the results in the read-eval-print-loop (REPL).

Start the REPL from the command line, and try the language as we move along.

```bash
./repl
```

Remember, you'll need to restart the REPL for it to pick up any changes you make to the language.

You have now already made a simple language, able to evaluate nested arithmetic expressions. It is time to add the ability to use control structures. 

For our language, an `if` statement will suffice. The `if` takes three arguments. The first one is the predicate `p`, which is always evaluated. The second **or** third argument is then evaluated and returned depending on the value of `p`.

### Play while you work

Remember that the REPL is a great way to play around with your language while you work on it.

```bash
./repl
→  (if (> 42 100)
…      'foo
…      'bar)
bar
```

### What's next?

Go to [part 4](4.md) where we add environments that'll enable us to work with variables.
