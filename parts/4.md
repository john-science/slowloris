## Part 4: Variables and Types

All variables in Slow Loris are mutable. That is, after we assign a value of any kind to a variable name we can change the value associated with that name as often as we like.

To assign a value to a variable name, you might type:

```lisp
(def x 3)
```

This defines an integer value of `3` to the name `x`. Notice that, like Python, Slow Loris determines the type of your variable (in this case an integer) from context.

Here are some more examples of variables of different types defined in Slow Loris:

```lisp
(def x 3)                ; defining an integer
(def pi 3.14159265)      ; defining a float
(def name "Slow Loris")  ; defining a string
(def bool False)         ; defining a boolean
(def lst '(0 1 2 3 4))   ; defining a list of integers

(def meta '(False 1 2.2 "three" '(4)))  ; defining a list of mixed types
```
