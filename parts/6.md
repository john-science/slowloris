## Part 6: Lists

### What is a List?

In Lisp one of the fundamental data structures is *the list* (the name Lisp is derived from *list processing* after all).

*Coming Soon*

### Working with Lists

There are several basic forms for working with lists:

- `cons` is used to construct lists from a "head" element, and the rest of the list (the "tail")
- `head` extracts the first element of a list
- `tail` returns the rest of the elments, once the first is dropped
- `empty` takes a list as input, and returns `True` if it is empty and `False` otherwise

However, in Slow Loris there are also two unique list operators:

- `rhead` extracts the last element of a list ("reversed head")
- `rtail` returns the rest of the elments, once the last is dropped ("reverse tail")
