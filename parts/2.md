## Part 2: Evaluating Slow Loris

After Slow Loris code is parsed, it needs to be evaluated. This is a recursive process. The entire AST of interest is passed to the evaluator, in `evaluator.py`, which then tests to see if the AST is a list, a symbol, or an atom. Each of these will evaluated separately, but evaluating a list or an atom can in turn cause another evaluation of a smaller piece of the AST.

The evaluator includes a lot of functionality built right in to the language natively, such as:

working with lists, defining functions, looking up variables by name, basic mathematics, basic string manipulation, and basic logic.

- basic arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `mod` and `>`) on two numerical arguments
- basic string manipulations (`"quoted text"`str_append` and `str_split`)
- basic logic operations (`and`, `or`, and `if`)
- `quote` takes one argument which is returned directly (without being evaluated).
- `atom` also takes a single argument, and returns true or false depending on whether the argument is an atom.
- `eq` returns true if both its arguments are the same atom, and false otherwise
