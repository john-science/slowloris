## Part 7: Standard Libraries

### What is a Standard Library?

A standard library in any programming language is a collection functions and tools considered so useful they are always available to programmers. In Slow Loris, all standard libraries are written in Slow Loris itself, like any other library you might use. In `slowloris/stdlib` there are several files containing tools useful in a wide variety of programs.

### Popular Standard Libraries

#### Logical Operators

These operators allow you to combine boolean values into other boolean values. For instance, instead of just:

```lisp
(if boolean "True Result" "False Result")
```

You can combine two booleans and test of they are both `True`:

```lisp
(if (and boolean1 boolean2) "True Result" "False Result")
```

Slow Loris includes the four most common logical operators:

 * `and`
 * `or`
 * `xor`
 * `not`
