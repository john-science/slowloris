## Part 7: Standard Libraries

### What is a Standard Library?

A standard library in any programming language is a collection functions and tools considered so useful they are always available to programmers. In Slow Loris, all standard libraries are written in Slow Loris itself, like any other library you might use. In `slowloris/stdlib` there are several files containing tools useful in a wide variety of programs.

### Popular Standard Libraries

#### Logical Operators

These operators allow you to combine boolean values into other boolean values. For instance, instead of just:

```lisp
(if boolean "True Result" "False Result")
```

You can combine two booleans and test of they are both `True`:

```lisp
(if (and boolean1 boolean2) "True Result" "False Result")
```

Slow Loris includes the four most common logical operators:

 * `and`
 * `or`
 * `xor`
 * `not`

#### Exceptions

It is an important feature of any modern language for the developer to be able to throw an exception if an undesirable situation has been reached. Slow Loris offers only one basic type of exception (`LispError`), which can be raised like this:

```lisp
(raise "Give some description of the undesirable state.")
```

#### List Functions

#### List Sorting Functions

Slow Loris includes by default two different list-sorting algorithms: Quick Sort and Insert Sort. Both will take a list of numbers or letters and yield a sorted list of those same elements in ascending order. Though Insert Sort is included, Quick Sort will almost always be a more preferable choice. These sorting algorithms can be called like this:

```lisp
(quick-sort '(1 7 3 5 1 9 4 2 0 0))
(insert-sort '(1 7 3 5 1 9 4 2 0 0))
```
