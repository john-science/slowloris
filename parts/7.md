## Part 7: Standard Libraries

### What is a Standard Library?

A standard library in any programming language is a collection functions and tools considered so useful they are always available to programmers. In Slow Loris, all standard libraries are written in Slow Loris itself, like any other library you might use. In `slowloris/stdlib` there are several files containing tools useful in a wide variety of programs.
